# Tinkercademy Employee Onboarding System

A comprehensive, production-ready onboarding system that fully automates employee creation in Talenox with integrated HR notifications.

## Overview

This system completely automates the employee onboarding process by:
- Collecting all required information in a single comprehensive form
- **Automatically creating employees in Talenox** with proper field mapping
- **Auto-generating sequential employee IDs** (300+ range)
- **Creating jobs and setting up user accounts** with automatic invitations
- **Sending HR notifications** with employee details and internal IDs
- Supporting **200+ nationalities** with proper citizenship status mapping
- Handling **all major Singapore banks** with correct Talenox formatting
- **Background processing** with 15-minute timeout for reliable API operations

## Current Process vs. Automated Process

### Old Manual Process
1. Collect basic info (name, email, NRIC)
2. Manually create Talenox entry
3. Employee receives Talenox invitation email
4. Employee fills additional information in Talenox
5. Employee submits bank details via separate Google Form
6. HR manually processes and updates records

### New Automated Process
1. Employee fills **single comprehensive form** (2-3 minutes)
2. System **automatically creates complete Talenox employee** with all data
3. System **generates sequential internal employee ID** (300+ range)
4. System **creates appropriate job** with correct pay structure
5. System **sends Talenox account invitation** automatically
6. System **notifies HR** with internal employee ID and details
7. **Done!** Employee receives Talenox login instructions immediately

## API Response Format

### Success Response
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Employee created successfully",
  "employeeId": "EMP-12345"
}
```

### Error Response
```json
{
  "error": "Validation failed",
  "details": ["Start date is required for interns"]
}
```

## Background Processing

The system uses an **Express.js server** with Docker containerization for reliable deployment:

### How It Works
1. User submits form → Immediate 202 Accepted response
2. System processes in background (up to 15 minutes)
3. Creates employee → Creates job → Sends notifications
4. User sees "processing" message with instructions

### Benefits
- **No more timeouts**: 15-minute limit vs 10-second regular functions
- **Better reliability**: Handles slow API responses gracefully
- **Same code**: Minimal changes from regular functions
- **Automatic retry**: Built-in error handling

### User Experience
- Form submission feels instant (< 1 second)
- Clear messaging about background processing
- Instructions to check email for confirmation
- HR contact info if issues arise

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Method not allowed" error**
   - Ensure you're using POST method
   - Check CORS configuration

2. **"Validation failed" errors**
   - Check all required fields are filled
   - Verify NRIC/FIN format (e.g., S1234567D)
   - Ensure dates are logical (end > start)

3. **"Internal server error"**
   - Check Docker logs: `docker-compose logs`
   - Verify environment variables are set
   - Ensure Talenox API is accessible

### Debug Mode

The form works without Talenox credentials for testing:
- Validates all inputs
- Returns demo employee ID
- Logs would-be API payload
